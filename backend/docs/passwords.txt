Password Security Best Practices

Strong passwords are your first line of defense against unauthorized access to your accounts and systems.

Characteristics of Strong Passwords:
- At least 12 characters long
- Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special characters
- Not based on personal information
- Unique for each account

Common Password Mistakes:
1. Using "password123" or similar simple passwords
2. Reusing the same password across multiple accounts
3. Using birthdays or names
4. Writing passwords on sticky notes
5. Sharing passwords with others

Password Management Tips:
- Use a password manager to store passwords securely
- Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible
- Change passwords regularly (every 3-6 months)
- Never share passwords via email or text
- Create passphrases using random words

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as:
- SMS code sent to your phone
- Authentication app code
- Biometric verification (fingerprint, face)
- Hardware security key

Password Recovery:
Always set up secure recovery options for your accounts, but be cautious of security questions that can be easily guessed.
