Firewalls and Network Security

A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

How Firewalls Work:
Firewalls act as a barrier between your trusted internal network and untrusted external networks like the internet. They examine data packets and decide whether to allow or block them.

Types of Firewalls:
1. Hardware Firewalls - Physical devices protecting entire networks
2. Software Firewalls - Programs installed on individual computers
3. Network Firewalls - Protect entire networks
4. Host-based Firewalls - Protect individual devices

Firewall Rules:
Firewalls use rules to determine what traffic to allow:
- Block all traffic by default
- Allow only necessary connections
- Filter based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols
- Log suspicious activity

Benefits of Firewalls:
- Blocks unauthorized access
- Prevents malware from spreading
- Monitors network traffic
- Protects against hackers
- Controls what programs can access the network

Best Practices:
- Always enable your firewall
- Keep firewall software updated
- Configure rules based on your needs
- Regularly review firewall logs
- Use both hardware and software firewalls for maximum protection
- Don't disable firewall to solve connectivity issues

Common Firewall Ports:
- Port 80: HTTP (web traffic)
- Port 443: HTTPS (secure web traffic)
- Port 22: SSH (secure shell)
- Port 21: FTP (file transfer)
