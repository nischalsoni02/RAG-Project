Virtual Private Networks (VPN)

A VPN is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.

What VPNs Do:
- Encrypt your internet traffic
- Hide your IP address
- Create a secure tunnel between your device and the internet
- Protect your data from eavesdropping
- Allow secure remote access to company networks

How VPNs Work:
When you connect to a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through an encrypted tunnel to a VPN server. This hides your real IP address and encrypts all data.

Types of VPNs:
1. Remote Access VPN - Connects individual users to a network remotely
2. Site-to-Site VPN - Connects entire networks together
3. Client-based VPN - Software installed on devices
4. SSL VPN - Browser-based VPN access

Benefits of Using VPN:
- Security on public WiFi networks
- Privacy from ISPs and websites
- Access to company resources remotely
- Protection from hackers
- Bypass geographic restrictions

When to Use a VPN:
- Working remotely
- Using public WiFi (cafes, airports, hotels)
- Accessing sensitive company data
- Traveling abroad
- Protecting personal privacy

VPN Protocols:
- OpenVPN - Open source, highly secure
- IKEv2/IPSec - Fast and stable
- WireGuard - Modern, lightweight protocol
- L2TP/IPSec - Older but widely supported

Choosing a VPN:
- Strong encryption (AES-256)
- No-logs policy
- Fast connection speeds
- Server locations
- Reliable customer support
- Compatible with your devices

Important Notes:
- Free VPNs may log and sell your data
- VPNs slow down internet speed slightly
- Not all VPNs are equally secure
- Company VPNs are different from consumer VPNs
