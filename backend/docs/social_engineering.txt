Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people to trick them into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

Common Social Engineering Techniques:
1. Pretexting - Creating a fake scenario to obtain information
2. Baiting - Offering something enticing to trick victims
3. Tailgating - Following authorized people into restricted areas
4. Quid Pro Quo - Offering a service in exchange for information
5. Impersonation - Pretending to be someone else

Real-World Examples:
- A caller pretending to be from IT support asking for your password
- A USB drive labeled "Employee Salaries" left in a parking lot
- Someone claiming to be a delivery person asking to be let into the building
- A fake tech support popup claiming your computer is infected

Why Social Engineering Works:
- Exploits human trust
- Creates urgency or fear
- Uses authority and intimidation
- Takes advantage of people wanting to be helpful
- Relies on lack of security awareness

Protection Strategies:
- Verify the identity of anyone requesting information
- Never share passwords or sensitive data over phone or email
- Be suspicious of urgent requests
- Follow company security policies
- Think before you click or respond
- Report suspicious contacts to security team

Red Flags:
- Requests for sensitive information
- Pressure to act quickly
- Appeals to authority or fear
- Offers that seem too good to be true
- Requests to bypass normal procedures

Training and Awareness:
Regular security awareness training helps employees recognize and resist social engineering attacks.
